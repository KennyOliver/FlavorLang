variable_declaration ::= "let" IDENTIFIER "=" expression ";" ;
print_statement      ::= "scran" expression ("," expression)* ";" ;
if_statement         ::= "if" condition ":" block ("elif" condition ":" block)* ("else" ":" block)? ;

## 🍳 **Syntax Examples**

Below are examples showcasing the unique (& fun) syntax of FlavorLang. They give a taste of the cooking-inspired syntax.

### 1. 👋 **Hello World**

The simplest program to print "Hello world!".

```py
scran "Hello world!";
```

### 2. 🍲 Defining Variables

Use `food` to declare and initialize variables.

```py
let name = "Chef";
let age = 25;

scran "Name:", name;
scran "Age:", age;
```

### 3. 🔄 Conditional Logic

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control program flow.

```py
food oven_temperature = 200;

if oven_temperature > 180:
    scran "The oven is hot!";
elif oven_temperature == 180:
    scran "The oven is just right!";
else:
    scran "The oven is too cold!";
```

### 4. 🔁 For Loop

Use `for` to iterate a block of code.

```py
for food i = 1 to 5:
    scran "Mixing... Step", i;
```

### 5. 🔄 While Loop

Use `while` for condition-based repetition.

```py
food flour_added = 0;

while flour_added < 3:
    scran "Adding flour...";
    food flour_added = flour_added + 1;

scran "All flour has been added!";
```

### 6. 📦 Functions with Return

Use `prep` to define functions and `serve` to return values.
Note that `burn` **takes precedence** over `serve`, stopping execution immediately.

```py
prep bake_cake with let temperature:
    if temperature < 180:
        scran "Temperature is too low to bake!";
        burn "Cake burned!";  # Stops function execution immediately
    else:
        scran "Baking cake at", temperature, "degrees!";
        serve "Cake is ready!";

let result = bake_cake with 200;
scran result;
```

### 7. 🛠️ Error Handling

Use `try` and `crumbs` to handle errors.

```py
try:
    burn "This recipe failed!";
    scran "This won't run!";
crumbs:
    scran "Caught an error: Recipe needs improvement.";
```

### 8. 📄 File Operations

- `Plate`: Write to a file.
- `Garnish`: Append to a file.
- `Gather`: Read from a file.

```py
plate "output.txt" with "Freshly baked cake ready to serve!";
garnish "output.txt" with "\nDon't forget the toppings!";

food data = gather "output.txt";
scran "File Contents:";
scran data;
```

### 9. 🔎 Switch-Case Logic

Use `when` and `is` for multiple condition matching.

```py
food dessert = "cake";

when dessert:
    is "cake":
        scran "Bake the cake!";
    is "pie":
        scran "Prepare the pie!";
    else:
        scran "Dessert not on the menu.";
```

### 10. 📥 User Input

Use `taste` to accept input from the user.

```py
scran "What's your favorite dessert?";
let favorite = taste;

scran "You chose:", favorite;
```
