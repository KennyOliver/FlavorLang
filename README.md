## üå∂Ô∏è Why FlavorLang? <a id="why-flavorlang"></a>

- **Unique & Fun**: Express your programs like recipes!
- **Flexible Execution**: File extensions and flags allow customized program behavior.
- **Readable Syntax**: Keywords like add, mix, cook, and deliver make code approachable and enjoyable.
- **Debug-Friendly**: Easily trace and test your code step-by-step with `--debug` mode.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start <a id="quick-start"></a>

**Get up and running with FlavorLang in just a few steps!**

### 1. Install the Compiler

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KennyOliver/FlavorLang.git
$ cd src
$ make
```

### 2. Write Your First Recipe

```py
# recipe.flv

serve("Welcome to FlavorLang!");
```

### 3. Run the Program

```
$ ./flavor recipe.flv

Welcome to FlavorLang!
```

### 4. Debug Your Code

Enable debug mode to inspect tokens and execution flow.

```bash
$ ./flavor recipe.flv --debug
```

This will print detailed information about the tokenization and parsing process.

---

## üöÄ Execution Flags & Behaviors <a id="execution-flags--behaviors"></a>

```bash
$ ./flavor recipe.flv          # Default execution
$ ./flavor recipe.flv --debug  # Debug mode
```

The `--debug` flag is really useful for understanding how FlavorLang is executing (tokenizing, parsing, and interpreting) your file.

## Data Types

| Data Type | Syntax Example    | Capacity/Range                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`  | `"Hello, world!"` | Size depends on system memory and encoding (e.g., UTF-8). Null-terminated, variable length.        |
| `float`   | `3.14`            | `FLOAT_SIZE` (long double, 64-bit to 128-bit): Platform-dependent, typically up to ¬±1.1E¬±4932.     |
| `integer` | `42`              | `INT_SIZE` (long long int, 64-bit): ‚àí9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.       |
| `boolean` | `True` / `False`  | `1` for `True`, `0` for `False`. Typically stored as 1 byte, though this can vary by architecture. |

### Explanation

- **string**: In C, the language used to make FlavorLang, strings are null-terminated arrays of characters. The length is limited by system memory and encoding. For example, in UTF-8 encoding, a string can take varying amounts of space per character depending on the character set.
- **float**: The `FLOAT_SIZE` type is a `long double`, offering a precision and range larger than the standard `double`. Its range is platform-dependent but typically up to ¬±1.1E¬±4932 on 128-bit implementations.
- **integer**: The `INT_SIZE` type is a `long long int` with a range from ‚àí9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, suitable for large integer values.
- **boolean**: Booleans are typically stored as `1` (`True`) and `0` (`False`). While logically they are 1-bit, they are typically stored in 1 byte for practical reasons.

## VS Code Syntax Highlighter Extension

## Install the VS Code Syntax Highlighter for FlavorLang

### 1. Build the Extension

- Navigate to the `vscode-extension` folder and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd vscode-extension
  npm install
  ```

### 2. Package the Extension

- Use vsce (Visual Studio Code Extension Manager) to create the `.vsix` package:

  ```bash
  npx vsce package
  ```

This generates a `.vsix` file in the vscode-extension folder.

### 3. Install in VS Code

- Open VS Code.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Mac) and select _`Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`_.
- Select the generated `.vsix` file.

Open a `.flv` file in VS Code.
You should see custom syntax highlighting for FlavorLang!
