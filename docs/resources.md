## Inspiration Languages

The syntax &amp; features draw inspiration from the following languages:

- **Python**: For its simplicity &amp; readability.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: For its flexible yet structured approach to programming, as well as its C-like syntaxm, which I much prefer to Python/Ruby and the like.
- **Rust**: For its focus on modern syntax, like ranges.
