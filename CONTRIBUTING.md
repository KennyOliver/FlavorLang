## How to Contribute

### 1. Create or Find an Issue

Contributions must be linked to an existing issue. If no relevant issue exists, create one and provide a clear description of the problem or feature.

### 2. Get Authorization

Wait for explicit authorization (via comment or mention) before starting work on any issue.

### 3. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KennyOliver/FlavorLang.git
cd FlavorLang
```

### 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch based on the `main` branch for your contribution. Use the following naming convention:

```bash
git checkout -b issue-<N>
```

Where `N` is the number of the issue you are addressing. E.g., `issue-123`.

### 5. Make Frequent and Descriptive Commits

Commit your changes often to ensure progress is clear. Avoid committing large bulk changes; keep changes atomic and focused. Use descriptive commit messages in the format:

```
Action: Title
```

**Example:**

```
Fix: Error caused by `function`
```

Provide a detailed description for each commit in the commit body. Mention the issue number using `#N` in the commit description. Enclose any mentions of code (e.g., `my_func`, `my_var`) in backticks for clarity.
Also ensure that any text in the git commit description is done in bullet points.

**Example:**

```
- Did something.
- Some explanation of what was fixed.
- Why the fix was needed / what the issue was.


#123
```

### 6. Push Changes

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin issue-<N>
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Submit a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository. Include:

- A detailed description of your changes.
- A screenshot demonstrating your code in action.
- Reference to the related issue (e.g., "Closes #N").

### 8. Code Review and Testing

Your pull request will undergo a code review. All GitHub Actions tests must pass before merging. After approval, we will merge your changes into the `main` branch.

## Coding Standards

### Commit Standards

- Use frequent, descriptive commits.
- Follow the format: `Action: Title`.
- Include issue references (e.g., `#N`).
- Enclose code mentions in backticks.
- Use bullet points for git commit descriptions.

### Code Quality

- Write clear and concise comments.
- Ensure consistent formatting (e.g., proper indentation, no trailing spaces).
- Add or update tests when applicable.

## Code of Conduct
